**Air Quality Analysis in Yogyakarta during the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine**

A Machine Learning project using two machine learning methods, which are Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine to analyze the air quality in Yogyakarta during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on the results, we can conclude that the best classification method to use on determining the predicted air quality in Yogyakarta is the Support Vector Machine model. The SVM model has a more accurate result than the Naive Bayes model using the same dataset.
